Vectorize the Text Data: Before feeding the data into a model, you need to convert your text data into a numerical format. This is typically done using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings. Since you're planning to use an RNN, word embeddings might be more appropriate.

Create Dataloaders: For training in PyTorch, it's convenient to use DataLoader objects. These allow for easy batching, shuffling, and loading of the data during training.

Define the Model: You've already defined your RNN model class (DocumentRNN). Ensure that it's suitable for your task and ready to be instantiated.

Train the Model: Instantiate your model, define a loss function and an optimizer, and write a training loop. During each epoch, you'll feed batches of data to the model, compute the loss, and update the model's weights.

Evaluate the Model: Use your validation and test sets to evaluate the model's performance. This typically involves computing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Based on the performance on the validation set, you might want to tweak your model's hyperparameters.

Save/Load the Model: Once you're satisfied with the model's performance, save it so you can reload it later without needing to retrain.
