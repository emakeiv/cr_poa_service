Your setup and workflow sound well-organized for the task at hand. You've got a MinIO S3 service running through Docker Compose, which is a great choice for handling file storage, especially for a large number of documents. Let's break down the next steps in your workflow:

1. Uploading Documents to MinIO S3
You've already uploaded 78 scanned documents to a bucket named power-off-attorney-samples in your MinIO S3 service. This is a good start for your training dataset.

2. OCR Processing
For each document in the MinIO bucket:

Retrieve the document via the FastAPI endpoint.
Send the document to the OCR service (like Tesseract) to convert the scanned document images into text.
3. Preprocessing Text Data
Once you have the OCR-processed text, perform preprocessing steps:

Cleaning: Remove any artifacts from the OCR process.
Normalization: Convert text to a lower case, remove unnecessary punctuation, etc.
Tokenization or Lemmatization: Depending on your requirement and the complexity of your model, you might tokenize or lemmatize the text.
4. Saving to PostgreSQL
Store the processed text into your PostgreSQL table power_of_attorney_ml_training_samples. This table should have at least two fields: the processed text and its corresponding label (whether it is a power of attorney document or not).

5. Building the Dataset
Make sure each document's text is correctly labeled for its category.
This dataset will be used for training your NLP model for document classification.
6. Model Training
Once you have enough data, use it to train your NLP classification model.
Libraries like Spacy, NLTK, or machine learning frameworks like Scikit-learn can be used for this purpose.
7. Integration and Testing
Integrate the trained model with your FastAPI application.
Test the end-to-end flow: uploading a document, processing it through OCR, classifying it with your model, and ensuring the results are as expected.
8. Continuous Improvement
As you gather more data, continually retrain your model to improve its accuracy and robustness.
Your approach is systematic and covers all the essential aspects of building a machine learning pipeline for document classification. The key is to start with a baseline model and iteratively improve it by tuning and expanding your dataset.
